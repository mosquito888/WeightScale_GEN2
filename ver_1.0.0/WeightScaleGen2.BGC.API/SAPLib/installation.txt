SAP Connector for Microsoft .NET 3.1 (aka NCo 3.1)

General information
-------------------
NCo 3.1 for .NET (core) requires a .NET (core) runtime 8.
Please see SAP note 3152653 (https://me.sap.com/notes/3152653) for a current and detailed list of
supported platforms and .NET (core) runtimes. The latest version of NCo 3.1 can be downloaded from
the SAP Support Portal at https://support.sap.com/nco. There you will also find all available 
distribution packages for the various supported processors as well as the NCo 3.1 Documentation in
PDF format.

Installation at development time
--------------------------------
For installation simply unzip the archive of NCo for .NET (core) to an arbitrary directory on your
machine. To integrate NCo into your .NET (core) application, you need to reference the provided
files in your Visual Studio project. You can add these assembly libraries via "Add COM References".
Please note that the shared library ijwhost.dll cannot be directly added as a reference in the
project. Instead, this DLL should be copied directly into the same directory as the build results
of your application.

Installation at runtime
-----------------------
For installation simply unzip the archive of NCo for .NET (core) to the directory on your machine, 
in which your NCo application has been deployed. Assuming that the .NET (core) runtime has been 
properly installed as shared runtime, you can find all available installations using the command
dotnet --list-runtimes. 
In order to start your application, you need a command similar to the following to ensure using
the shared runtime: 
dotnet --fx-version 8.0.6 D:\apps\nco\myNCoApp.dll
